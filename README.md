Welcome to my machine learning journey! 👋 I'm tackling an exciting challenge - predicting auction prices for bulldozers using machine learning techniques.

---

### 🎯 Project Goal
I'm diving into the fascinating world of price prediction by answering one key question:

> Can we accurately predict a bulldozer's future sale price using its characteristics and historical sales data?

### 📊 Data Overview
I'm working with the [Kaggle Bluebook for Bulldozers competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/data) dataset, which includes:

| Dataset | Description | Time Period |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| `Train.csv` | Main training dataset | Through end of 2011 |
| `Valid.csv` | Validation dataset | Jan 1 - Apr 30, 2012 |
| `Test.csv` | Final evaluation dataset | May 1 - Nov 2012 |

### 📈 Evaluation Metric
I'm using **RMSLE (Root Mean Squared Log Error)** to measure prediction accuracy:
- Compares predicted prices against actual auction prices
- Lower RMSLE = Better predictions
- [More details about evaluation](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/overview/evaluation)

### 🔍 Features
The model uses various bulldozer characteristics for predictions:
- Machine specifications
- Usage history
- Configuration details
- Previous sale information
